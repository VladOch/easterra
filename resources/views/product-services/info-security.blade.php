     Web Service Security
     The variety of modern web services— from online banking to arrangement of a visit to a doctor — is so wide that substantiated vulnerability analysis and flexible security approaches become a must-have. Our integrated approach includes:
     Web Application Firewalls (WAF) to detect and block web resource attacks on the application layer;
     DDoS protection tools;
     vulnerability analysis services and tools that allow to optimize security systems configuration;
     penetration testing — a proactive approach to vulnerability detection;
     analysis of web application source code using specialized tools.

        This page was written in HTML and CSS. The CSS was compiled from
        SASS. I used Normalize as my CSS reset and -prefix-free to save
        myself some headaches. I haven't quite gotten the hang of Slim for
        compiling into HTML, but someday I'll use it since its syntax
        compliments that of SASS. Regardless, this could all be done in
        plain HTML and CSS.

        By making the open state default for when :checked isn't detected,
        we can make this system accessable for browsers that don't recognize
        :checked. The fallback is simply an open accordion. The accordion
        can be manipulated with Javascript (if needed) by changing the
        "checked" property of the input element.
